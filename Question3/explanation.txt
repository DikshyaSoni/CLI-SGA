1. File Creation Create a file named sample_data.txt in your home directory and add some sample text to it. 
command:

echo "This is some sample text for testing links." > sample_data.txt

cat sample_data.txt

Explanation :

'echo "text" > sample_data.txt' =  creates the file with sample content.
 'cat sample_data.txt' displays the content.

2. Hard Link Creation Create a hard link to sample_data.txt named sample_hard.txt. 

command:
ln sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt

Explanation : 'ln sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt'  = creates a hard link sharing the same inode.


3. Symbolic Link Creation Create a symbolic (soft) link to sample_data.txt named sample_soft.txt. 

command:
ln -s sample_data.txt sample_soft.txt
Explanation :
 'ln -s sample_data.txt sample_soft.txt'  = creates a symbolic link pointing to the file name.

4. Inode Verification Display the inode numbers of sample_data.txt, sample_hard.txt, and sample_soft.txt.

command:
ls -i sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt sample_soft.txt
Explanation :
   'ls -i'  = shows inode numbers.
 Hard link shares the same inode; symbolic link has a different inode.


 6. File Metadata Inspection Display detailed file information (permissions, ownership, size, timestamps) of sample_data.txt. 

command:

Explanation :
   'ls -l --time-style=full-iso' =  shows permissions, ownership, size, timestamps.
